Help design a clean, RESTful or GraphQL API for the functionality in the selected code.

Consider:
1. Resource modeling and relationships
2. Endpoint structure and naming
3. Request/response formats
4. Query parameters and pagination
5. Error handling and status codes
6. Authentication and authorization requirements
7. Versioning strategy
8. Documentation format (OpenAPI/Swagger)

Provide:
- API specification in the appropriate format
- Example requests and responses
- Implementation guidance for the current codebase
- Security considerations

Ensure the API follows best practices for the chosen style (REST/GraphQL) and maintains backward compatibility where needed.
