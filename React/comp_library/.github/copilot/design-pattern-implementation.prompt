Analyze the selected code and suggest appropriate design pattern implementations to improve its structure.

1. Identify current architectural weaknesses or areas that could benefit from established patterns
2. Recommend specific design patterns (Creational, Structural, Behavioral) that address these issues
3. Provide example refactored code implementing the suggested pattern(s)
4. Explain the benefits of the pattern implementation including:
   - Improved maintainability
   - Better testability
   - Enhanced extensibility
   - Reduced complexity

For each suggestion, explain why this pattern is appropriate for this specific context and provide both before/after comparisons to illustrate the improvement.
