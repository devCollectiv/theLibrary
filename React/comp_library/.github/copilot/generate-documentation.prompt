Generate comprehensive documentation for the selected code including:

1. Function/class purpose and overview
2. Detailed parameter descriptions with types and constraints
3. Return value explanation
4. Usage examples with expected outputs
5. Edge cases and error handling behavior
6. Any dependencies or prerequisites
7. Performance characteristics and complexity (time/space)

Format the documentation in the appropriate style for the language:
- JSDoc for JavaScript/TypeScript
- DocString for Python
- JavaDoc for Java
- XML comments for C#
- etc.

Include appropriate markdown formatting and ensure documentation is clear enough for both new developers and experienced maintainers.
